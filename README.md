# UFOs

HTML and JavaScript on Dynamic web applications for presenting UFO data table.

## Challenge

2. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Technologies

- CSS
- d3
- HTML

## Recommendations

- **We could add more filters such as "*durationMinutes*" and keyword searching in "*comments*" using regular expression.**
